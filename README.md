Huertodo is a Full Stack Web App which enables users to monitor their gardens remotely

-Created using: PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap

-Implemented a login system which enables both users and workers to access their private spaces. 

-The business model follows this process: No registered user visits the page, contacts the company wanting a vertical monitorable garden, workers handle all the budget process, measuring and garden setup. Meanwhile, workers contact each order and manage the process using their private spaces in the App. Finally, they register the user when the setup and payment is finished, and the user is able to monitor his gardens remotely in the App.

-In case you want to test the user private space here are the credentials for one of the registrated users: joselgarciamant1@gmail.com | mementoMori46
